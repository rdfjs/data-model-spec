# RDFJS Representation Task Force

The RDFJS Representation Task Force is a focus group of the [RDFJS Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/rdfjs/).
We strive to design interface specifications with the goal that different JavaScript implementations of RDF concepts can interoperate.

The focus on this first [low level](https://github.com/rdfjs/rdfjs.org/wiki/Architecture#low-level) interface is to find a minimal API for access of RDF data which can be shared by JS Libraries.

This repository contains documents created by the Representation Task Force:
