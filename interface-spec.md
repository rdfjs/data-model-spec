# Interface Specification: RDF Representation

## Mission Statement
This document provides a specification of a low level interface definition representing RDF data independent of a serialized format in a JavaScript environment. The taks force which defines this interface was formed by RDF JavaScript library developers with the wish to make existing and future librariers interoperable. This definition strives to provides the minimal necessary interface necessary to enable interoperability of libraries such as serializers, parsers and higher level accessors and manipulators.


**Status:** This document is a _draft_.<br>
**Purpose:** This document proposes a uniform interface to represent RDF data in low-level JavaScript libraries.

## Design elements and principles
- We define data interfaces to represent **triples**, **quads**, **IRIs**, **blank nodes**, **literals** and **variables**.
- Instances of the interfaces created with different libraries should be interoperable.
- Interfaces do _not_ specify how instances are stored in memory.
- Interfaces mandate specific pre-defined methods such as `.equals()`.
- Given the necessity of methods, plain objects (JSON) cannot be used.
- Factory functions (e.g., `triple()`) or methods (e.g., `store.createTriple()`) create instances.
  - Should allow "upgrading" a plain object into a fully functional triple

## Data interfaces

### Term

Abstract interface.

**Properties:**
- `String .termType` contains a value that identifies the concrete interface of the term, since Term itself is not directly instantiated.
  Possible values include `"iri"`, `"bnode"`, `"literal"`, and `"variable"`.
- `String .value` is refined by each interface which extends Term

TODO: read/write or read-only?

**Methods:**

- `.equals(Term other)` returns true if and only if the argument is a) of the same type b) has the same contents (value and, if applicable, type or language)

TODO: to what extent should we use typed signatures (`.equals(Term other)`) versus actual JavaScript signatures (`.equals(other)`). The benefit of typed signatures is that you see the type inline; the drawback is that it is more specific than JavaScript itself. For ease of use, JavaScript might be preferred, specifying types in the explanation (or jsdoc-style).

### IRI extends Term

**Properties:**

- `String .termType` contains the constant `"iri"`.
- `String .value` the IRI as a string (example: `http://example.org/resource`)

### BlankNode extends Term

**Properties:**

- `String .termType` contains the constant `"bnode"`.
- `String .value` blank node name as a string (example: `_:blank3`)

TODO: Does the value always start with an underscore?

### Literal extends Term

**Properties:**

- `String .termType` contains the constant `"literal"`.
- `String .value` the text value, unescaped, without language or type (example: `Brad Pitt`)
- `String .language` the language as lowercase [BCP47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) string (examples: `en`, `en-gb`)
- `String .datatype` the datatype IRI as string

TODO: What if the literal has no language? Does it always have a datatype?

### Variable extends Term

**Properties:**

- `String .termType` contains the constant `"variable"`.
- `String .value` the name of the variable (example: `?a`)

TODO: Does the value always start with a question mark?

### DefaultGraph extends Term

An instance of `DefaultGraph` represents the default graph.
It's only allowed to assign a `DefaultGraph` to the `.graph` property of a `Quad`. 

**Properties:**

- `String .termType` contains the constant `"defaultGraph"`.
- `String .value` contains an empty string as constant value.

### Triple

**Properties:**

- `Term .subject` the subject, which is an IRI, a BlankNode or Variable.
- `Term .predicate` the predicate, which is an IRI or Variable.
- `Term .object` the object, which is an IRI, a Literal, a BlankNode or Variable.

**Methods:**

- `Boolean .equals(Triple other)` returns true if and only if the argument is a) of the same type b) has all components equal

### Quad extends Triple

**Properties:**

- `Term .graph` the named graph, which is an IRI, a BlankNode or Variable.

TODO: Do we need to define a different interface, or is a quad simply a triple with a graph different from undefined?

### DataFactory

**Methods:**

- `.iri(String iri)` returns a new instance of IRI.
- `.blankNode()` returns a new instance of BlankNode.
- `.literal(String value, String language, String datatype)` returns a new instance of Literal.
- `.variable(String name)` returns a new instance of Variable. This method is optional.
- `.defaultGraph()` returns an instance of DefaultGraph. This method should return a singleton.
- `.triple([Object])` returns a new instance of Triple. 
- `.quad([Object])` returns a new instance of Quad.

TODO: `.blankNode()` could/should have an optional suggested label.

TODO: `.literal()` could have a more intelligent constructor (valid language strings are not valid IRIs and vice-versa).

TODO: `.literal()` should support IRI datatype as well

TODO: Can/should `.literal()` accept built-in types like integers?

TODO: `.variable` is marked "optional", but what does this mean? Perhaps we need different stages of compatibility. Are quads optional, for instance?

TODO: Can `.triple` and `.quad` also support three/four-part constructors?

TODO: Can `.triple` and `.quad` also support simple strings, or should they be Terms?

TODO: Is the argument of `.triple` and `.quad` optional (or why the brackets)?

TODO: Can `.triple` and `.quad` just be aliases of each other?
